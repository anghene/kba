I've reached out to my coordinating professor and we discussed the base idea of my application.
I started out wanting to offer an alternative to the dated credentials model (user/pass). I quickly dismiss the idea of offering an online keychain-like service and arrived to the very appealing concept of using dynamic KBA (location based KBA, more specifically) as outlined in this great Open Access paper published on Springer titled ["Designing challenge questions for location‐based authentication systems: a real‐life study"](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs13673-015-0032-3 "Link to published article") published June 2015.
